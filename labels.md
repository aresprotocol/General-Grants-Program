# Issue Creation & Labels

The issues page of this repo shows the topics that we are currently interested in or collaborating on. Labels are useful as they can be used to filter issues and let people find all the issues in the same category easily (e.g. meetups). Ideally, issues added by W3F staff members will already have labels; however, for anyone who wants to add a new issue to repo then they should consider labelling their issues as the issues are added.


### Creating new issues

Adding new issues is easy and simply requires clicking on the "New Issue" button then choosing a sensible title and filling out the the main comment box.

Titles should follow a similar style to that the issues that already exist. The text in the comment box should be structured and as detailed as appropriate. Please see the example document to gain an understanding of how a standard issue (or issue reply) should look: [examples document](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/blob/master/response-examples.md)

## Label Overview
In this sub-section we will describe the intended use of the issue labels. Some issues will also have multiple labels. To gain a better understanding it might simple be best to look at how other issues are already labelled (please see the [issues page](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/issues/)).


### Development Labels

The Development labels show initiatives that we are interested in talking to development teams about. Often this will be for a particular piece of software within the Polkadot ecosystem: e.g. new parachains, new wallets etc.

### Engagement Labels

The intention of the 'Engagement' labels is to indicate where W3F has the desire to work with an external team on a particular issue. It is anticipiated that these issues will mostly pertain to development work.

### Ecosystem Labels

While our team is still relatively small we expect most of our effort will be focused upon Polkadot; however, as part of our grander vision we do have an interest in the issues of the wider Web 3 ecosystem. As such, we have a number of labels to denote which ecosystem an issue fits under.

We have already helped to fund some initiatives within the Ethereum ecosystem via EthPrize and Ethereum Community Fund, but we are also constructing a process to do that in-house.

### Error Labels

It is not expected that these labels will be used, but if they are then it will be temporarily and to point out that there is an error with the issue.

### Funding Labels

In some cases, it will possible to receive funding for certain issues. Funding is never a guarantee, so these labels are best left for W3F staff to attach to an issue.

### Meetup Labels

At the moment there is only a single meetup label. This is intended since we want people to be able to filter all the issues quickly and find the meetup issues.

All meetup issues should have this label. Example: [Berlin](https://github.com/w3f/Web3-collaboration/issues/2).

### Status Labels

These labels denote the status of a particular issue. They are most appropriate for meetups, but could in theory be used for other issues.

### Testing Labels

The testing labels may not be widely used at the moment, but as we get closer to launch the more testing that we anticipate the network will need. Open issues with these labels indicate that a particular piece of software requires testing. For example, it could be that the latest PoC code needs to be downloaded and tested.
